<h1>dox-docco</h1>

<p>A docco-like formatter for the dox comment parser</p>

<h2>How does this differ from Docco?</h2>

<p>Dox parses block style JS comments,  while Docco parses single-line comments.  In effect, this is Docco for block-style comments.  I also wanted to create an example template using Dust.js for the output of Dox.</p>
