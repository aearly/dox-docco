dox-docco
=========

A docco-like formatter for the dox comment parser


How does this differ from Docco?
--------------------------------

Dox parses block style JS comments,  while Docco parses single-line comments.  In effect, this is Docco for block-style comments.  I also wanted to create an example template using Dust.js for the output of Dox.
